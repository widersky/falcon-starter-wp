## Framework Classes

You may ask - "What's the difference between `Customizer` and `Optimizer` classes?" and it's right question. The difference is quiet simple:

`Optimizer.Class` is responsible for disabling functions that are not necessary for our website or might make website slow / vulnerable.
`Customizer.Class` allows us to disable or enable options which do not noticeably affect the speed of WordPress.
